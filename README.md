# neural-networks-homework

The purpose of this project was to create a neural network to evaluate funding applicants for a venture capital firm.

Data used: an applicant data csv with labeled success column

Preprocessing: used one hot encoder to encode features and StandardScalar for scaling data. Used train_test_split to separate out X & Y training and test data.

Summary:
I tested various layer options and activation functions but solution resulted in similar accuracy as the original neural network.
